# Graphite

This is a PyQt image annotation software that allows adding text annotations to regions of images drawn directly on them. It stores the annotations in the EXIF data of the image (Right now just supports JPG, but PNG and TIFF also can contain EXIF data). The intent of this is to assist in the creation of labeled data for training NLP systems on understanding complex plots, handwriting, and more.

This was created as an experiment with ChatGPT providing help and snippets of code to get started. ChatGPT did write the initial start of the code, however there was significant human debugging and refactoring through the process (and I quickly gave up trying to get it to write *all* the code).
